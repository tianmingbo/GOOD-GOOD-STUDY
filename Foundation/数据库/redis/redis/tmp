/* Try to expire a few timed out keys. The algorithm used is adaptive and
will use few CPU cycles if there are few expiring keys, otherwise
it will get more aggressive to avoid that too much memory is used by
keys that can be removed from the keyspace.

No more than CRON_DBS_PER_CALL databases are tested at every
iteration.

This kind of call is used when Redis detects that timelimit_exit is
true, so there is more work to do, and we do it more incrementally from
the beforeSleep() function of the event loop.

Expire cycle type:

If type is ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_FAST the function will try to run a
"fast" expire cycle that takes no longer than EXPIRE_FAST_CYCLE_DURATION
microseconds, and is not repeated again before the same amount of time.

If type is ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_SLOW, that normal expire cycle is
executed, where the time limit is a percentage of the REDIS_HZ period
as specified by the ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_SLOW_TIME_PERC define./
